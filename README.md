# About

These are all my macOS dotfiles, which can be used to make transitioning to macOS easier when using my Linux dotfiles.

> Right, almost forgot, I mainly use **Arch Linux**


# Major components

I use
- Alacritty
- Brave
- VSCodium


# Installation

I have provided install scripts in the root of this directory. By default, they will not override anything and symlink to this directory.

If you want to install one version permanently (making it harder to upgrade), change the line `alias l="ln -s"` to `alias l="cp"`.

Other instructions will be shown when running the scripts.


# Contribution

Well, these are my personal dot-files. If you notice any issues, please open an issue, but I don't think I'll accept PRs if they're not well justified.

Anyway, you can use this under the MIT license.
