# About

These are all my dotfiles (lightly modified to fit my laptop), which can be used to complete a setup with Intel integrated graphics and an Intel processor (intel-ucode, can be easily swapped with amd-ucode).

> Right, almost forgot, I use **Arch Linux**. Sorry, `i use arch btw` ðŸ˜Ž

Removing the Intel packages, tweaking the Xorg config and changing the [ucode](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Microcode) should be enough to make it vendor agnostic.

## Branches

To use this setup on multiple systems, I've got multiple branches.

A branch named `macos` is available in this repo for other macOS users. It uses `homebrew` for managing packages.

One named `laptop` is for a more light-weight install for a laptop using Intel graphics, with Intel microcode. It looks virtually the same.

# Major components

I use
- i3 gaps
- picom (ibhagwan's fork)
- polybar
- dunst
- rofi
- Kitty
- NeoVim
- Firefox
- Brave
- paru
- spotifyd
- iwctl (for connecting to WiFi)
- Blueman (for connecting to Bluetooth)

# Installation

I have provided install scripts in the root of this directory. By default, they will not override anything, but symlink to this directory.

If you want to install one version permanently (making it harder to upgrade, as deleted files are left), change the line `alias l="ln -s"` to `alias l="cp"`.

Other instructions will be shown when running the scripts.

To install all the packages with Paru, follow the installation instructions from [their GitHub](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru)
and run this in a Fish shell (or add a `$` before the parentheses in Bash).

> To view the PKGBUILDs, you need to have [NvimPager](https://github.com/lucc/nvimpager) installed,
> as described in my [other installs](other-installs.md) document.
> It is set as the `$PAGER`, and not having it installed results in no output from Paru about PKGBUILDs.

```shell
$ paru -Suy (cat packages/installed.txt)
```

# Contribution

Well, these are my personal dot-files. If you notice any issues, please open an issue, but I don't think I'll accept PRs if they're not well justified.

Anyway, you can use this under the MIT license.
